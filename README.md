## üõ†Ô∏è Parameters You Can Change

- **`ports` list:**  
  Edit the `ports` list inside the script to scan the ports you need. Example:

  ```python
  ports = [22, 80, 443, 8080, 3306]

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization
### Changing Ports to Scan
By default, the script scans common ports like `80 (HTTP)`, `443 (HTTPS)`, `22 (SSH)`, `21 (FTP)`, and `3389 (RDP)`.

To **add** or **modify** the list of ports:

- Find this function inside the code:
  ```python
    def port_scan(host, ports=[80, 443, 22, 21, 3389]):
- Add more ports into the ports list. (Example ‚Äî adding SMTP (25) and MySQL (3306)) :
  ```python
    def port_scan(host, ports=[80, 443, 22, 21, 3389, 25, 3306]):
