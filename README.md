## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization
### Changing Ports to Scan
By default, the script scans common ports like `80 (HTTP)`, `443 (HTTPS)`, `22 (SSH)`, `21 (FTP)`, and `3389 (RDP)`.

To **add** or **modify** the list of ports:

- Find this function inside the code:
     ```python
     def port_scan(host, ports=[80, 443, 22, 21, 3389]):
- Add more ports into the ports list. (Example ‚Äî adding SMTP (25) and MySQL (3306)) :
     ```python
     def port_scan(host, ports=[80, 443, 22, 21, 3389, 25, 3306]):

## üñ• Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection (for external tests like speed test)
### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
